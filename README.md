The Art of Worldly Wisdom (Spanish: Oráculo Manual y Arte de Prudencia) is a book written in 1647 by Baltasar Gracián y Morales, better known as Baltasar Gracian. It is a collection of 300 maxims, each with a commentary, on various topics giving advice and guidance on how to live fully, advance socially, and be a better person, that became popular throughout Europe.

This repo contains a shell script `maxims.sh` which will print a random maxim to standard output. All maxims can be found in the `maxims` file.

Just add a call to the shell script `maxims.sh` from your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` if you want to get a random maxim everytime you open your shell.
